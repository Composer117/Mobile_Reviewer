"It's a Tiny Little Beast.
   
   
  Flawless performance. Works with extreme Smoothness. Worth the price.
   
   
  Upgraded it to iOS 11.0 and I must say, the phone's performance just got better than ever.
   
   
  Captures Crisp 4K Videos and mind blowing Slow Motion Sequences.
   
   
  I can't say any awesome than this. Speechless!

"I checkwd the warranty on apple site.. it was fine.. however people who like small phones should only go for this.. not good for media consumption..display quality is ok.
   
  Battery is a bit poor but ok..
   
  Sound quality is cool.. premium body.. the main advantage of this phone is that it IS BEAST in performance..as good as a gophone 8 .. back camera is good as it is same that of 6s..
   
   
  Overall it is a cool device..apple is definately better than any androids.in my op

"An iPhone is an iPhone.... and if you want great class in compact handy package then this is the one for you. Camera, sound, looks and many other things can out perform many of the latest android devices at this range. Android phones do the tricks by hyping small unnecessary changes in order to just lure the customer.....where apple keeps it simple and nice. e.g. FHD is the latest fashion in phone's screen....while in iphone it's still retina display with less pixels...but I found the display is adequately bright and very crisp and clear.
   
  same applies to the camera. never count megapixels.....
   
  the foremost thing is the interface.....u can copy it, u can make clone of it, but cannot match the fluidity and security of iPhone.

"Upgraded from an android phone to iPhone.
   
  First impression for iPhone is that it is blazingly fast.Boot and power off is so fast.Opening of apps is also fast.
   
  Size perfectly fits to hand.
   
  Didn't face any difficulties to operate.
   
  IPhone doesn't get luke warm also.So forget about any heating and crashing of apps in iPhone.
   
  Sound clarity is very good and both cameras clarity is awesome.
   
  This iPhone Se fits to my expections along with my budget.So went ahead in buying IPhone Se.
   
   
  I am totally happy to upgrade from an android phone to iPhone.

"Hi all,
   
  I am writing this review after using the phone for 6 days. Trust me guys if you want to buy an iPhone then start from here. Before buying this phone I was using Redmi note 3.i am still using the note 3 one along with this phone. Below are the detailed info about the phone.
   
   
  1- the phone looks awesome and you can easily use it one handedly. Bit small but doesn't matter. It's really powerful from inside.
   
   
  2- once the battery is fully charged, UT depends upon you how you are using the phone. For me I use it for call, Facebook, Internet surfing, whatsaap, and all. I can guarantee you that it will last for 30 hours for sure if you are using the phone under 4G all the time.
   
   
  3- I have seen in some comments People say that the phone has some heating issues. I actually laugh at them. This is iphone, you shouldn't ask micromax kind of questions. No heating issues at all. I simultaneously use music, 4G,facebook,whatsapp,but still no heating. Trust me I have bought this phone after hell lot of investigation.
   
   
  4- the display is really good. It is not full HD but you can't find the difference from any angle. Touch is flawless. Screen is small but still you can feel the magic when you type something. Here one thing I want to mention. If you are planning to buy this phone then be careful. You shouldn't break the display. They will charge 15500 to change only the display. So I will suggest you to buy one good back cover which will protect the corner as well as the screen.
   
   
  5- coming to the camera. I am not a photographer but I can blindly say the 1. 2 MP front camera will give you some photos which you will not find from a 5 or even 8 MP camera in any other phone.
   
   
  6-processing is completely smooth. Far far far better than an android processor. Never you will find any lagging or any slowness.
   
   
  Finally I will say this is an awesome phone. Previously people used to say that Apple charges too much extra for all these, for those kind of people I will say, there is a word called class which you will feel from your heart. If you are coming from Android to ios then for first two days you will feel like inside a jail. But after that you will feel safe and happy.
   
   
  If this comment is useful for you then please share your feedback.

"Even in 2018 this phone is far ahead of android phones in terms of ui and smooth operation. Anyone who is not in love with large screen phones will love this phone for its speed and handling convenience. My friend who bought moto G5s plus when I bought this phone is regretting his purchase and wished that he had bought iPhone se.

"superb experience. with my first iphone

"Little beast is what I call it. I was using OnePlus 3, however wanted to venture into the Apple world and this model seemed to be a good reason to not spend too much but get the taste of the ios.
   
   
  This phone packs great features, read through reviews and watch YouTube videos before you make your decision. This one is a fast feature packed phone. Becomes my primary phone from today.
  
  
   
   "
"I have been using iPhone SE for quite a lot of time and I can tell you guys that go for it. it's the value for money Apple product and it has iOS 11 update and also it runs smoothly in anything and it takes much sharper clear images with 12 megapixel camera with 4K video Recording out of the box and  2 GB of RAM is well enough for it to handle any kind of apps and graphics intensive games. If you're trying to buy a smaller display super phone I would recommend to buy iPhone SE and don't go for the iPhone 6s if you want the biggest screen and the same features go for the 6S it comes with a bigger screen but it comes with a lot of cost too and as the display of iPhone SE smaller the processing is much much more better in any kind of daily usage. and it has  better battery and the battery longevity is much better if you charge it around like 10 PM at night and then you wake up at 8 AM in the morning you will see that 99% charge left. Reason is because better iOS optimisation and better standby time of iOS side recommend all of you to go for this phone instead of going any big phones and after using the few days you will just get better at the keyboard typing it won't bother at all. For those of you who are reading my review thanks for reading it and the whole review is written through iOS keyboard voice recognition The bit of an example ;)
   
  good luck :)

"Extremely dissatisfied with Flipkart and product

"Till now running smooth.but more than 1000 reviews don't favor the purchase.Wait &amp;watch.
   
  Wanted small one hand operational phone. satisfied.
  
  
   
   "
"All time android user here using this as my secondary phone but this phone does impress. Perfect phone if you prefer a practical device with the primary purpose of calling and mixed multimedia usage. Sound quality with the bundled earphones is impressive.
   
   
  The best feature is the battery life. For a 1624mah battery, the phone has impressive battery life. With mixed usage you can get a screen on time of around 4 hrs and in low power mode you can further stretch it to 6hrs. Standby battery life is nothing short of impressive. If you leave it on wifi at 100%  at night, you'll be amazed to see it still at 100% in the morning.
   
   
  Though it has a smaller screen compared to current media consumption standards, the pixel density of 401ppi gives you a sharp display. The screen is sufficiently large for playing casual games and normal media consumption.
   
   
  It supports LTE and VoLTE for all present operators. Call quality and network reception is great. Wi-Fi supports both bands.
   
   
  On the performance front it is very snappy and there is no lag at all. IOS user interface is smooth and snappy by design. It supports the latest IOS 12.1 update and would undoubtedly support upcoming iOS versions.
   
   
  Camera quality is great in day light and manageable in low light. Front camera is good for casual video calls but could have been better.
   
   
  The form factor is great. Personally I find iPhone SE as the best designed phone. Worth keeping as a collectible.
   
   
  If you're skeptical in buying this phone in 2018, go ahead without a doubt. You won't regret.
   
   
  PS: This device looks best in the Rose gold colour.
   
   
  thanks!

"Apple iPhone SE (Space Gray)
   
  Very nice and a beautiful phone. After using for the last 10 days (purchased on 18.072018)
   
  I am sharing my experience.
   
   
  Pros
   
   
  a.  Although the screen size small we don""t feel so.
   
  b.  The os is upgraded to ios 11.4.1 and the software his very smooth.
   
  c.  It takes 3 or 4 days to adjust to this phone especially from android to
   
  ios once aquited it one will definitely love it.
   
  d.  Back camera is wonderful especially in live mode.
   
  e.  For one hand usage it is very comfortable.
   
  f.  It is very compact and very easily sits in your pocket.
   
  g.  Display, speaker volume, internet usage, phone calling are very good.
   
  h.  Design is good.
   
   
  Cons
   
   
  i.  The battery charging stands for one day only for normal usage.
   
  However it takes only one hour for full charge.
   
  j.  One difficulty is we have to purchasse certain apps.
   
  k.  The selfie camera is not that good. Performance is so good in low light
   
   
  Conclusioon : Even today you can safely go in for this phone without hesitation.
   
  Especially this will be useful for senior citizens.

"Please don't buy iPhone specially from flipkart. My iPhone SE rose gold is not getting detected in itunes and not vale to charge. They are not agree for the replacement.
  
  
   
   "
"If anyone interested to buy iphone in budget basis &amp; 5s design+classy look then blindly go for it ... I love this smartphone with more updated things compared to 5S &amp; performance is good compared to iphone 6... it's really short &amp; capable in one hand so it's very comfortable for 1hand users... battery capacity also fine... for me after 1month heavy usage still I'm getting more than 14hrs standby time even with full gaming &amp; using of social media... but camera quality is average but it's somewhat genuine for this product...
  
  
   
   "
"I have used the phone for an week so now it's the time for a review.
   
  Call quality awesome. Battery lasts more than a day on moderate use. Charging time 40-45 minutes.
   
  Typing  is a bit difficult initially, but you will adjust later. Touch is superb, fingerprint identification is a bit slow but accurate. Camera is better than the mid range android phones present at the moment (e.g. Mi5, Moto  G5 etc.)
   
   
  This is a niche product and for those who want smaller phone in high quality, there is no other alternative present at the moment.
   
   
  Don't go for it if you can't live without a big screen.

"This is the best iPhone ever.
   
  It has got the best design of iPhone that has ever been made.
   
  It is a beast in a little body.
   
  It is faster than iPhone 6s as it has same processor but requires less processing power because of its small size.
   
  I bought it because I prefer smaller phones that can be used single handedly.
   
  The only con is the 1.2mp front camera but it hardly matters because that too is good.
   
  I recommend you to buy this if you want a super fast phone in small size.

"Good product from apple.i satisfied but the packaging could be better.Apple making best products since starting and this phone is mini and affordable version of iPhone 6S...Just go for it if want to buy a iPhone mini size and want Mid-range Apple features in such a affordable price.And don't just look at RAM management,Apple systems are so much RAM efficient and my son using this phone since 1/1.5 years but no hangs or lags at all and Interface is awesome.
  
  
   
   "
"In the world full of Phablets with large screens, iPhone SE is true Phone experience.
   
   
  Design : One of the best Apple has made so far. The blend of aluminium and glass makes this phone look flawless and with its unique design and compact form factor it stands out of crowd.
   
   
  Connectivity : You've got everything covered here. It supports VOLTE , NFC is there for Apple Pay ( may be enabled in future) and yes, our beloved 3.5mm jack is there.
   
   
  Software : I have used Windows Phone and Android earlier. Windows Phone never used to hang or stutter but had lack of apps. iOS proved to be even better with its highly optimised interface and apps. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that Android is bad but iOS is certainly clean and optimised experience than Android and Android has its own advantages.
   
   
  Camera : 12MP Rear camera is best in this price range giving accurate colors and life like pictures. Front camera is also very good considering it's 1.2MP. The only place where it struggles is low light conditions where front camera takes a big hit. Video capabilities are amazing with upto 4k/30fps and 720p/240fps of slo-mo.
   
   
  Display and controls : Display is very well calibrated with 326 ppi enough to give you great experience. Alert slider and 1st gen touch id is there, yes it is slower than most of todays flagships but you won't notice a difference unless you'll compare. Just take it as a security feature which prevents accidental unlocks ;).
   
   
  Performance : With A9 chipset performance is flawless, enough to do any task or to play any game. M9 co-processor keeps track of your activities all day like counting steps and serves another useful features.
   
   
  Audio : Inbuilt speaker audio quality is very good but not very loud. The bundled earpods are amazing giving you the music with every details.
   
   
  Battery : It will last you easily throughout the day for normal usage. Infact, its battery backup is even better than 6s and 7.
   
   
  In short, if you can live with a phone with 4 inch display, just buy it.
  
  
   
   "
"Speaker volume is too low that u can't hear the other side voice.
   
  I complain and they refused to return the phone.
  
  
   
   "
"first time I am not appreciate with flipkart. I purchased this phone on 16 August and there was mentioned 10days replacement. After 2days flipkart telling no replacement you can visit service center .
  
  
   
   "
"If you think that this phone is outdated. I gotta say that you really don't know the iPhone SE.
   
  Take the literal meaning of BEAST.
   
  It's  astonishingly powerful for its segment,
   
  and can make the OnePlus 6 or the S9 awestruck by lagging behind by a meager margin of 1-3s.
   
  The only con according to me is it's battery life.
  
  
   
   "
"Excellent phone, can read to any corner of phone with 1 finger.... screen quality matters than quantity with respective to reach ability
   
   
  , Having broken my nexus 6 display and after using stock android for long time, started looking for options and boils down to these phones
   
   
  ( redmi note 5 pro , ASus Max pro m1 , nokia 7 plus , One plus 6 ) even recently announced Mi A2 ...... all these devices were excellent but with one big no ...all device are 6 inches+body...
   
   
  which after buying nexus 6 and using it felt too big of a devices in hand , in pocket or either on call and not suitable for one hand usage,
   
   
  so  decided looking for 5 inch sub devices in android and to my reach wasn't able to get a single decent devices except for some moto devices and some boxy sony phones which i didnt like....also got used the stock android , miui and stuff with many devices.
   
   
  then saw the iphones -- 6 , 6s and se ( 7 , 8  ~ no headphones jack , over priced , same software's running on all iPhone)
   
   
  iphone 6 -- 2014 launch -- 4 yrs older device , recently removed for apple website  (1 gb ram , 8 mp camera , same 1.2 front cam)
   
   
  iPhone SE -- 0.7 inches smaller than iphone 6 , exactly same spec of iPhone 6s with out the 3D touch and latest fingerprint , no deal breaker for me
   
   
  so decided this device for the same purpose....as offer promoted by flipkart
   
   
  maybe Steve jobs was right about the 4 inch devices .... hope v ll see some android devices soon with smaller form factor.
   
   
  AS said its my perspective ~ first ios device.... lets see how things goes...

  Second thing is the great phone wait it's iPhone that's what apple and people says about it the quality and everything is top notch it works great no chances of lag in this apple
   
  A9 processer with 2gb ram multitasking is also great and camera is way better than any phones in this category for 20-30k
   
  So I strongly recommend you that you should get this one if big screen isn't your priority

"Hello Everyone. I got this mobile and its a fault one. the touch pad is not working and system hang.  so when i contacted flipkart they said Apple product cant be replaced . i have to visit the Apple customer care only. they is no replacement for the apple product. so dont buy any apple product from Flipkart. If you want a Grantee of apple product. Buy only from Apple store or authorize store bcoz they have a policy of 72 hours replacement in case of the fault product.
   
   
  This is honest review and i'm sharing my experience.  so dont get exicted with the flipkart offers/discount. you will loose ur money and get a fault product.

"In midst of all these big screen phone, this chota bijlee is a awesome phone. The specification &amp; performance is too good. All latest features have been updated by IOS in this phone. A recommendable phone for all those like me looking for a small phone with all latest features. After thsi phone i done have any other phone at this screen size which offers you the same features.
   
   
  Thank you Flipkart for offering the product at such a competitive price. From you our dreams of owning branded costly products are coming true.

"This is my first iphone and I am new to the IOS. For long time I was looking for a small but powerful mobile for which,I think its perfect.4 inch display body design is very comfortable to use. After 2 years of launching iPhone SE,its still performs well. Back camera is good.but comparison to my old Moto g5 s camera, moto g5 camera is better. I dont have to write about other specs as it is available on the net and YouTube. A little bit worry about the apps since most apps comes with a price tag. still daily necessary apps are free, so not to worry  about that. sound of apple products are awesome and the best. Does not come with a fast charge. I am a moderate user and battery back up is good to me.about 24 to 30 hours. Body design gives a better grip than todays most round body designs. I love the product.comlare the size from the image.thank you filpkart for fast delivery.

"The iPhone SE  gold 32 gb is awesome ...... I love it..... specially its size .... before I used 5.5 inch screen .. so I thought it was a small screen ..... within 2 days of using it.... I thought this is the perfect size...... easy to handle.... love to use........ but I don't like ekart service....... through which it was sent.....no issue in this phone .... I love its camera and its performance , size every thing.... somehow it's resolution should be better.....

"Got this in 19k.After using 1 month, I'm reviewing it. Delivery was in time. Packaging was good. The phone I got was a brand new one, manufactured in sept 2017 .No complain for flipkart service and product .Now,about the product,I wanna say, iphone se is seriously awesome.Smoothly working,no hangs,lags. Speed is good. Multitasking is good. Battery lasts only 1 day after normal use . SOT is 4.5 to 5 hrs with all day data on.Takes 1:30 hrs to get full charged. 4"" display is seriously looking small to me after using android. 12 MP rear camera captures very good pics but front camera is better than ok. Doesn't got heat up like android. Doesn't have user friendly customization like android.Security is superbb.Its 2GB ram is equal to android's 4 or 6gb ram as I have already installed heavy apps which run flawlessly.My 1st ever iphone and trust me I'm damn glad after having it.So without thinking, just go for it.
